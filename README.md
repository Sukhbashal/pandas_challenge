Objectives:

This is a PyCitySchools data, which was analysed by me to make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. This data is comprised of 15 schools of both charter and districts type.  I have been provided with access to every student’s math and reading scores, as well as various information such as budget of the schools they attend. I aggregated the data to showcase the following trends in school performance:

o	District Summary
o	School Summary
o	Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
o	Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
o	Math Scores by Grade
o	Reading Scores by Grade
o	Scores by School Spending
o	Scores by School Size
o	Scores by School Type

Conclusions:

1.	When comparing Top Performing Schools versus Bottom Performing schools (By % Overall Passing), Charter Schools outperform District schools by approximately 40% in math and reading. 
2.	Average reading scores were higher than math scores in the District Summary.  Speculating whether or not students score higher as they progress through High School, I performed further calculations to determine each level of High School (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th grade). The combined schools’ average math score was 80% and the average reading score for each grade was 82%.  These figures correlate to the District Summary table as well.
